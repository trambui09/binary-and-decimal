# Binary and Decimal
In this assignment you'll be composing two methods based on the description
below. Complete the method templates provided in binary_and_decimal.rb file.

## Exercises
1. Write a method named `binary_to_decimal` that creates an array of size 8.
   Fill the array randomly with 0’s and 1’s. Print out the array so that it
   appears as a binary number. Calculate the decimal value for this binary
   number using the algorithm you devised in class. Print out the decimal value.
2. This question has two parts:
   - <strong>Devise an algorithm</strong> Imagine you've been given two sets of integers. e.g. the first set is [30, 20, 10, 4] and the second set is [20, 10, 4]. Devise an algorithm that comapres the two sets and returns true if the two sets have the same integers and in the same order, and returns false otherwise. e.g. In our example case, for [30, 20, 10, 4] and [20, 10, 4], the two sets do not have all the same integers (30 is the difference) and the order is only partially the same. So, the algorithm should return false.
   - <strong>Author a method</strong> named `array_equals` that accepts two integer arrays as parameters (representative of the two sets). The method return `true` if the arrays contain the same elements in the same order, and returns `false` otherwise. 
Note: Do not use Array class methods for comparing the whole array at once. You may use array indexing to retrieve one element at a time, compare individual elements with each other and you may retrieve the length of an array.
